This small example project demonstrates how to subclass, instantiate and run
multiple instances of an NSOperation that is an NSURLConnection delegate. 

I initially created it to assist on a StackOverflow question I asked
(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9684770/create-run-multiple-instances-of-nsoperation-subclass) 
because it wasn't running the NSURLConnections correctly, but having since gotten it
working I decided to leave this here as a helpful code snippet to anyone else who 
might have arrived here with the same issue!

The class initially was intended to run only 1 NSOperation at a time as part of a much larger
project due to the memory constraints of current/previous-gen iDevices, but for smaller 
downloads you can easily bump up that limit, just change the line in LibSync.m:
 
    [operationQueue setMaxConcurrentOperationCount:1]; // Can set this as needed
    
Hope this helps someone! Happy coding
