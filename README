This example project is a much smaller version of the one I'm trying to implement in our
main project, but with the same implementation and same issues.

I'll assume you came here from my StackOverflow post so I won't re-explain everything,
but if you found all the code on the SO post too un-followable you can grab the project
and see what it does (and hopefully point out what silly mistake I've made)!

Thanks :)
